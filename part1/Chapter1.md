Identifiers and Keywords
---

####Legal Identifiers

* Identifiers must start with a letter, a currency character `$`, or a connecting character such as the underscore `_`. Identifiers cannot start with a digit!
* After the first character, identifiers can contain any combination of letters, currency characters, connecting characters, or numbers.
* In practice, there is no limit to the number of characters an identifier can contain.
* You can't use a Java keyword as an identifier.
* Identifiers in Java are case-sensitive; foo and FOO are two different identifiers.
